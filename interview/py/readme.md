    <summary>What are the benifit of using python?</summary>

    1. Easy to use– Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to use, read, write and learn.

    2. Interpreted language– Since python is interpreted language, it executes the code line by line and stops if an error occurs in any line.

    3. Dynamically typed– the developer does not assign data types to variables at the time of coding. It automatically gets assigned during execution.
    
    4. Free and open-source– Python is free to use and distribute. It is open source.
    
    5. Extensive support for libraries– Python has vast libraries that contain almost any function needed. It also further provides the facility to import other packages using Python Package Manager(pip).
    
    6. Portable– Python programs can run on any platform without requiring any change.
    The data structures used in python are user friendly.
    It provides more functionality with less coding.

### What is the difference between .py and .pyc files?
```
The .py files are the python source code files. While the .pyc files contain the bytecode of the python files. .pyc files are created when the code is imported from some other source. The interpreter converts the source .py files to .pyc files which helps by saving time.
```

###  Is python case sensitive?
Yes. Python is a case sensitive language.

### What is the difference between Python Arrays and lists?
Arrays and lists, in Python, have the same way of storing data. But, arrays can hold only a single data type elements whereas lists can hold any data type elements.
```
a=arr.array('d', [1.1 , 2.1 ,3.1] )
print(a)
```

### What is a lambda function?
An anonymous function is known as a lambda function. This function can have any number of parameters but, can have just one statement.
```
a = lambda x,y : x+y
print(a(5, 6))
```
### What is pickling and unpickling?
Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string representation and dumps it into a file by using dump function, this process is called pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called unpickling.
